# Customer-Churn-Analysis
In this repository, I have taken a dataset of a telecom company and performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and identified the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model by applying different models, and lately, have deployed the model.
